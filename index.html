 <h1 >Nature</h1>
 <h1><b><i>Poem</i></b></h1>
    <p >  
 In fields of green and skies so blue,
Nature paints a vivid hue.
Whispers of the wind through trees,
A symphony of melodies.

Blossoms dance in the gentle breeze,
Caressed by sunlight with such ease.
Rivers weaving tales untold,
Nature's wonders, a sight to behold.

Mountains rise with majestic grace,
Eternal guardians of time and space.
Flowers bloom and rivers flow,
In the heart of nature, secrets grow.

Chirping birds in a chorus sing,
Celebrating the arrival of spring.
Moonlight casting a silver glow,
Nature's beauty, a timeless show.</pre>
